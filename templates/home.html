<h1>Introduction</h1> <br>
<h3 class = "left-aligned">Introduction to Statistical Analysis Application:</h3>
<p class = "left-aligned">This web application is designed as an interactive learning and computation platform for probability 
    and statistical inference. It integrates theoretical explanations with visualizations and calculators
     to help users understand statistical concepts and apply them to real data. Each section of the 
     application focuses on a specific area of statistics and is accessible through the navigation 
     sidebar.</p>

<h3 class = "left-aligned">Calculators:</h3>
<p class = "left-aligned">The Calculators section provides essential tools for computing fundamental statistical quantities. 
    Users can quickly evaluate summary measures and supporting values that are frequently used across
     hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, and distribution-based analysis.</p>



<h3 class = "left-aligned">Probability Distributions:</h3>
<p class = "left-aligned">The Distributions module explores commonly used probability distributions, including the Normal (Z), t, 
Chi-Square, and F distributions. These pages explain the theoretical properties of each distribution
 and allow users to:</p>
<ul> 
    <li> Visualize probability density curves.</li>
    <li> Compute Z-scores, critical values, and p-values.</li>
    <li> Understand how parameters such as mean, variance, and degrees of freedom affect distribution shape.</li>
</ul>
<p class = "left-aligned">This section supports both conceptual learning and practical inference.</p>


<h3 class = "left-aligned">Population Means:</h3>
<p class = "left-aligned">The Population Means section focuses on parameter estimation and hypothesis testing for means under various conditions.
It includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li> One population mean with known variance (Z-test).</li>
    <li> One population mean with unknown variance (t-test). </li>
    <li> Two population means assuming equal variances. </li>
    <li> Two population means assuming unequal variances. </li>
</ul>

<p class = "left-aligned">Each page combines mathematical derivations, step-by-step procedures, confidence interval construction,
 hypothesis testing logic, and interactive plots.</p>




<h3 class = "left-aligned">Population Proportions:</h3>
<p class = "left-aligned">The Population Proportions module addresses inference for categorical data. 
    Users can construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests for:</p>
<ul> 
    <li> A single population proportion. </li>
    <li> Two population proportions. </li>
</ul>
<p class = "left-aligned">These tools demonstrate how normal approximations are applied to proportions 
    and how conclusions are drawn using test statistics, critical values, and p-values.</p>





<h3 class = "left-aligned">Chi-Square Tests:</h3>
<p class = "left-aligned">The <strong>Chi-Square Tests</strong> section includes:</p>
<ul> 
    <li> Goodness-of-Fit tests. </li>
    <li> Tests of Independence </li>
</ul>
<p class = "left-aligned">These pages are designed to analyze relationships between 
    categorical variables and assess whether observed data deviates significantly 
    from expected patterns.</p>







<h3 class = "left-aligned">Linear Regression</h3>
<p class = "left-aligned">The <strong>Linear Regression</strong> module introduces both 
<strong>descriptive</strong> and <strong>inferential</strong> aspects of regression analysis. 
Users can explore:</p>
<ul> 
    <li> The relationship between variables. </li>
    <li> Interpretation of regression coefficients. </li>
    <li>Hypothesis testing for model parameters. </li>
    <li>Graphical representations of fitted models. </li>
</ul>





<h3 class = "left-aligned">ANOVA:</h3>
<p class = "left-aligned">The ANOVA section focuses on comparing multiple population means simultaneously.
     It explains the underlying assumptions, test statistics, and decision-making process used to
      determine whether group means differ significantly.</p>
